This is a little curious research to give myself a better understanding into how 3D space is represented via computing. It's just crazy amounts of Googl-ing , unfortunately there are too many credits to references. **This is work in progress**. Although I have modified other's examples & created my own for my comprehension,  I hope this can be useful to anyone. ;-)

**A Refreshment on Matrices:**
Matrices are similar to 2D Arrays(). This is a 3x4 matrix (3 rows,4 cols).

Elements can be indexed using this notation: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julienetie/Study_3D-Matrices/master/equations/axy1.gif) x = row, y = column. 
A(2,3) = 7.
